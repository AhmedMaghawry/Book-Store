# Book Store project

- A bookstore application is a database system which has the capabilities of storing and retrieving information about books, customers, and orders.

- In this project, we are considering to develop a sample centralized relational Bookstore application database for the customers and managers at a book store.

- This database can be used to store the records of customers and their preferences, the technical/nontechnical books, magazines to which customers can be subscribed, and the customerorders to the shop (e.g. telephone orders of customer for books, etc.), to be sent to their address.

## Description :

**1.ER Diagram :**

- The design of the entity relationship model marked the start of our project. In this first step the scope of our final program was decided on. The reason for this is that every object added to this diagram would mean programming a whole new table in the final application. As work progressed the diagram was slimmed down a bit and two objects that we decided using at first were dropped later due to massive time pressure.
